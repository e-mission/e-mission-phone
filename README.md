e-mission phone app
--------------------

This is the phone component of the e-mission system.

Installing
---
We are using the ionic platform, which is a toolchain on top of the apache
cordova project. So the first step is to install ionic using their instructions.
http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/

Then, get the current version of our code

Fork this repo using the github UI

Clone your fork

``
$ git clone <your repo URL>
``

Restore platforms and plugins. This is a good time to get a cup of your favorite beverage

``
      $ ionic state restore
``

Install all javascript components using bower

``
      $ bower update
``

Installation is now complete. You can view the current state of the application in the emulator

    $ ionic emulate ios --target="iPhone-6"

Note that sometimes the IOS emulator doesn't work when called from command line, then you can simply load 
the project from Xcode, by opening

``
/e-mission-phone/platforms/ios/emission.xcodeproj
``

and then run the project with IOS emulator.
