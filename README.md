e-mission phone app
--------------------

This is the phone component of the e-mission system.

:sparkles: This has been upgraded to the latest **Android**, **iOS**, **cordova-lib**, **node** and **npm** versions. __This is ready to build out of the box.__

The currently supported versions are in [`package.cordovabuild.json`](package.cordovabuild.json)

Updating the UI only

[![osx-serve-install](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/workflows/osx-serve-install/badge.svg)](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone/actions?query=workflow%3Aosx-serve-install)

If you want to make only UI changes, (as opposed to modifying the existing plugins, adding new plugins, etc), you can use the **new and improved** (as of June 2018) [e-mission dev app](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-devapp/) and install the most recent version from [releases](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-devapp/releases). 

### Installing (one-time)

Run the setup script

```
bash setup/setup_serve.sh
```

### Activation (after install, and in every new shell)

```
source setup/activate_serve.sh
```
  
### Running

1. Start the phonegap deployment server and note the URL(s) that the server is listening to.

    ```
    npm run serve
    ....
    [phonegap] listening on 10.0.0.14:3000
    [phonegap] listening on 192.168.162.1:3000
    [phonegap]
    [phonegap] ctrl-c to stop the server
    [phonegap]
    ....
    ```
  
1. Change the devapp connection URL and press "Connect"
    - If you are running the devapp in an emulator on the same machine as the devapp server, you may simply use localhost, which would be `127.0.0.1:3000` on iOS and `10.0.2.2:3000` on Android.
    - If you are running the devapp on a different device, you must type the address manually (e.g. `192.168.162.1:3000`). Note that this is a local IP address; the devices must be on the same network
1. The app will now display the version of e-mission app that is in your local directory
  1. The console logs will be displayed back in the server window (prefaced by `[console]`)
  1. Breakpoints can be added by connecting through the browser
    - Safari ([enable develop menu](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-safari-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac)): Develop -> Simulator -> index.html
    - Chrome: chrome://inspect -> Remote target (emulator)
    
**Ta-da!** :gift: If you change any of the files in the `www` directory, the app will automatically be re-loaded without manually restarting either the server or the app :tada:

**Note**: You may need to scroll up, past all the warnings about `Content Security Policy has been added` to find the port that the server is listening to.

End to end testing
---
A lot of the visualizations that we display in the phone client come from the server. In order to do end to end testing, we need to run a local server and connect to it. Instructions for:

1. installing a local server,
2. running it, 
3. loading it with test data, and
4. running analysis on it

are available in the [e-mission-server README](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-server/blob/master/README.md).

The dynamic config (see https://github.com/e-mission/nrel-openpath-deploy-configs) controls the server endpoint that the phone app will connect to. If you are running the app in an emulator on the same machine as your local server (i.e. they share a `localhost`), you can use one of the `dev-emulator-*` configs (these configs have no `server` specified so `localhost` is assumed).

If you wish to connect to a different server, create your own config file according to https://github.com/e-mission/nrel-openpath-deploy-configs and specify the `server` field accordingly. The [deploy-configs](https://github.com/e-mission/nrel-openpath-deploy-configs/#testing-configs) repo has more information on this.

Pre-requisites
---
- the version of xcode used by the CI
    - to install a particular version, use [xcode-select](https://www.unix.com/man-page/OSX/1/xcode-select/)
    - or this [supposedly easier to use repo](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcode-install)
    - **NOTE**: the basic xcode install on Catalina was messed up for me due to a prior installation of command line tools. [These workarounds helped](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/macOS_Catalina.md).
- git
- Java 17. Tested with [OpenJDK 17 (Temurin) using Adoptium](https://adoptium.net).
- android SDK; install manually or use setup script below. Note that you only need to run this once **per computer**.
    ```
    bash setup/prereq_android_sdk_install.sh
    ```

    </details>
- if you are not on the most recent version of OSX, `homebrew`
    - this allows us to install the current version of cocoapods without
      running into ruby incompatibilities - e.g.
      https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/11763

Important
---
Most of the recent issues encountered have been due to incompatible setup. We
have now:
- locked down the dependencies,
- created setup and teardown scripts to setup self-contained environments with
  those dependencies, and
- CI enabled to validate that they continue work.

If you have setup failures, please compare the configuration in the passing CI
builds with your configuration. That is almost certainly the source of the error.

Installing (one time only)
---
Run the setup script for the platform you want to build

```
bash setup/setup_android_native.sh
```
AND/OR
```
bash setup/setup_ios_native.sh
```

### Activation (after install, and in every new shell)

```
source setup/activate_native.sh
```

### Enable HTTP support on android by editing `config.xml`

If connecting to a development server over http, make sure to turn on http support on android

```
    <edit-config file="app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml" mode="merge" target="/manifest/application">
        <application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"/>
    </edit-config>
```

### Building the app

We offer a set of build scripts to pick from, each of which: (i) bundle the JS with Webpack, and then (ii) proceed with a Cordova build.
The common use cases will be:

- `npm run build` (to build for production on both Android and iOS platforms)
- `npm run build-prod-android` (to build for production on Android platform only)
- `npm run build-prod-ios` (to build for production on iOS platform only)

There are a variety of options because Webpack can bundle the JS in 'production' or 'dev' mode, and you can build Android or iOS or both.
Find the full list of these scripts in [`package.cordovabuild.json`](package.cordovabuild.json)

Creating logos
---
If you are building your own version of the app, you must have your own logo to
avoid app store conficts. Updating the logo is very simple using the [`ionic
cordova resources`](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v3/cli/cordova/resources/)
command.

**Note**: You may have to install the [`cordova-res` package](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-res) for the command to work


Troubleshooting
---
- Make sure to use `npx ionic` and `npx cordova`. This is
  because the setup script installs all the modules locally in a self-contained
  environment using `npm install` and not `npm install -g`
- Check the CI to see whether there is a known issue
- Run the commands from the script one by one and see which fails
    - compare the failed command with the CI logs
- Another workaround is to delete the local environment and recreate it
    - javascript errors: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
    - native code compile errors: `rm -rf plugins && rm -rf platforms && npx cordova prepare`

Beta-testing debugging
---
If users run into problems, they have the ability to email logs to the
maintainer. These logs are in the form of an sqlite3 database, so they have to
be opened using `sqlite3`. Alternatively, you can export it to a csv with
dates using the `bin/csv_export_add_date.py` script.

```
<download the log file>
$ mv ~/Downloads/loggerDB /tmp/logger.<issue>
$ pwd
.../e-mission-phone
$ python bin/csv_export_add_date.py /tmp/loggerDB.<issue>
$ less /tmp/loggerDB.<issue>.withdate.log
```
