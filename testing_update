Testing Update as of 1/19/2019

Some people got recommendations but for those who weren't located in large cities, the API call resulted in a key value error. This was combatted by integrating the ProPublica API (allowing for unlimited calls using zip codes). The key value error was due to towns or a call resulting in only a zip code and not an actual city. For this reason, there was an error in giving back a suggestion. If trips are not cleaned, no suggestion will appear until the trip has been cleaned and a mode of transportation is associated with it. The suggestion system has been updated to guesstimate endpoints, since in some areas it can be difficult to pinpoint a restaurant (malls, parking lots, etc).

Sample tests and results:

-trip to Habachi Steakhouse via car (Hokkaido Teppanyaki Hibachi Steakhouse) recommended going to closer steakhouse (Echo and Rig) via public transit
-trip to In N Out Burger via car recommended biking to JJ's Burger Joint in Marin County 
-trip to Korean BBQ place via car suggested biking to a different bbq place (Smoking Pig BBQ) via bike

Testing is ongoing and continuous. The testing files are used by sending trips directly to iPython and stepping through with a debugger. A new pull request should be sent out soon. 
The results are being displayed on the page properly, unless there is an error with the suggestion system, in which case the page needs to be reloaded by the user.
