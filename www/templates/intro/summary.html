	This version of E-Mission is designed to record your travel behavior for a period of one week days in order to calculate your Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT). The application will collect trip location data, travel speed, and estimate mode of travel such as walking, biking, or vehicle. All data collected is used solely for the purpose of research for the research study at UC Berkeley’s Center for Community Innovation, entitled “Assessing the Travel Demand and Co-Benefit Impacts of Affordable Transit-Oriented Development.”
