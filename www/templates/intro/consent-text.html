<h3>Personal data and privacy policy</h3>

<h4>a. The experiments and the partners responsible for the analyzes</h4>

<p>
    When using the Ma Mobilité application for the first time, the User must choose which experiment/project to participate in, and depending on the experiment/project chosen, the processing and analysis of the data will be entrusted to a specific organisation.
</p>
<p>
    We can define three categories of users of the application:
</p>

<p>
    1- autonomous users: these are users who choose to use the application without being part of an experiment or a specific data collection project.
On the first use of the application these users will have to choose, “Autonomous user”.
</p>

<p>
    Their data won’t be shared with third parties for analysis, and will only be processed by La FabMob and Coop Carbone.
</p>

<p>
    2- Users recruited within the framework of inter-company travel management plans: these are the workers of companies participating in the program of travel management centers (CGD).
</p>

<p>
    Users within the framework of this project will have to choose at the time of the first use of the application “Intercompany travel plan”.
The companies have mandated the Metropolitan CGDs to analyze employee mobility.
</p>

<p>
    The data collected as part of this experiment will be shared with the Metropolitan CGDs, whose role will be to carry out the necessary analyzes on the basis of anonymized user data in order to share the results with the companies that have commissioned them.
</p>

<p>
    The FabMob, the Coop Carbone and the CGDs have contractually committed not to share user data with companies.
</p>

<p>
    3-Users as part of the “Carbon Footprint of Teleworking” project
They are the workers of the companies who participate in the project aimed at measuring the carbon footprint of teleworking.
</p>

<p>
    Users within the framework of this project will have to choose at the time of the first use of the application “Carbon Footprint of Teleworking”.
</p>
<p>
    The data collected as part of this project will be shared with research partners, namely INRS and Polytechnique Montréal, for data processing and analysis.
</p>

<h4>b. What data is collected and why?</h4>

<p>
    La Fabrique des Mobilités Québec and its partner Coop Carbone are responsible for processing user data. The data as well as the application will be hosted on secure servers of Digital Océan. La Fabrique des Mobilités Québec has contractually ensured that its partners ensure the security of the data collected by means of the Application.
</p>

<p>
    The Application may constitute one or more files comprising information provided voluntarily by the user or else retrieved through the operating system of the user's smartphone. The legal basis on which the processing of personal data is based is a contractual relationship. La Fabrique des Mobilités Québec undertakes to request and / or collect only the data necessary for the project aimed at understanding new travel habits and the provision of the services offered in accordance with principle 5 of the digital data charter (Digital sobriety ; Make reasoned and reasonable use of the data).
</p>

<p>
    The data collected by means of the Application and processed by FabMob and its partners, as well as the purposes of this processing are described below:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Purpose 1: identification of the user to find his data in the database.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Single user token;</li>
            <li>User creation timestamp;</li>
            <li>Associated operating system;</li>
            <li>Unique device identifier.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Purpose 2: visualization of traces of mobility by the user or the beta-tester with an estimate of his carbon footprint.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Geographic positions of the telephone.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Purpose 3: cleaning and correction of mobility traces so that the user can view them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Geographic positions of the telephone.</li>
            <li>Speeds detected by the operating system of the telephone</li>
            <li>Modes of transport detected by the operating system of the telephone</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The aforementioned data must be collected in order to be able to benefit from the services offered by the Application, namely the visualization of its traces of mobility and the '' estimate of the carbon footprint linked to its journeys. No data processing gives rise to automated individual decision-making or profiling.
</p>

<p>
    If the user does not want this data to be communicated to the server, he is then unable to use the Application.
</p>

<p>
    The following data is collected on an optional basis, and stored locally on the Application:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Purpose 4: estimation of certain personalized metrics based on physical characteristics (optional collection)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gender, height, weight, age (the collection of this data is not not mandatory to use the Application)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>c. How is the collected data used?</h4>
<p>
    The raw data is stored on the user's smartphone and continuously sent to a server which performs nightly processing to improve the data. These improvements consist of a processing in 8 steps:
</p>
<p>
    the position and speed data of the GPS are collected in the application (phone side) by querying the smartphone OS, then:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>sent (asynchronously) to the server for processing in deferred time (every night) in a processing pipeline:</li>
    <li>recovery of app data already recorded in the database;</li>
    <li>division into trips: after 5 'of immobility (configurable threshold), it is considered that this is another trip;</li>
    <li>cutting into sections;</li>
    <li>smoothing of sections: correction of potential GPS errors</li>
    <li>cleaning / temporal resampling of samples</li>
    <li>detection of the movement mode: the mode is detected as a function of the speed, and, for public transport, only by relying on the proximity of the start and end of the journey (section) and of a public transport stop (public transport stops are found on the OpenStreetMap database queried by the overpass API)</li>
    <li>verification of active modes: the mobile app allows the user to inform about an incident and correct the mode, or complete the reason for a trip.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The server hosting the Application as well as the data collected: TOR1 is located in Toronto, Canada, at the company Digital Ocean.
</p>
<p>
    No use for commercial purposes of this personal data is made by La Fabrique des Mobilités Québec and its partners (Coop Carbone and Savoir Faire Linux).
</p>
<p>
    To guarantee the right to privacy (preserve privacy and prevent surveillance) in accordance with principle 1 of the digital data charter, no individual processing of data will be carried out.
</p>
<p>
    The analyzes will be carried out on aggregated data. 
</p>
<p>
    Aggregate data is made up of individual data and is the result of a combination of different measurements. They are obtained by adding or averaging the individual values obtained. They make it possible to obtain information on groups that have common characteristics. We can aggregate by location, by characteristics or by analysis criteria.
</p>
<p>
    The Data visible in the “Dashboard” tab and corresponds to the indicators for each user of the application for a period defined by the User. 
</p>
<p>
    This data is not the subject of a specific database and is calculated on the fly for direct display in the users' application. These are the following indicators:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>total number of kilometers by mode of travel,</li>
    <li>number of trips by mode of travel,</li>
    <li>total duration of trips by mode of travel,</li>
    <li>speed by mode of travel</li>
</ul>
<h4>d. Data retention</h4>
<p>
    If the user deletes the Application, the data stored on the Application are immediately deleted and the data associated with his token (geographical positions, speeds, journeys) in the server are saved unless the user requests the deletion of their data.
</p>
<p>
    The data stored locally on the Application (gender, height, weight, age) are kept in the Application until the Application is deleted.
</p>
<p>
    The user can request the deletion of his data stored on the server (geographical positions, speeds, journeys) at any time.
</p>
<p>
    To do this, the user must go to the profile section, click on the delete my data option, he will be redirected to a page where he must enter his username and the email address with which he identified himself, then click on send.
</p>
<p>
    Once the deletion request has been processed, the user receives a confirmation by email.
</p>
<p>
    The processing time for this type of request can take up to 30 business days.
</p>
<p>
    FabMob keeps the personal data collected for the time necessary to perform the analyzes described herein, a maximum of 12 months following their collection. The data are then anonymized or aggregated and ceases to be associated with identifiable individuals. 
</p>
<h4>d. What ensures data security?</h4>
<p>
    Data protection In accordance with the digital data charter (principle 3: Cybersecurity; Protecting personal data), all user data is hosted in Canada, on facilities operated by Digital Ocean.

</p>
<p>
    A response will be formulated and sent within 30 working days of receipt of the email.
</p>
<h4>g. Data obtained via a questionnaire</h4>
<p>
    Periodically, when specific analyzes are carried out by FabMob and its partners, personal data is collected via a questionnaire.
</p>
<p>
    This data is associated with your account for the duration of such an analysis, but will not be subject to individual processing, and will only be used to identify trends or compile statistics within the framework of a particular analysis. . 
</p>
<p>
    The questionnaire as well as the data collected through it will be hosted and stored on the website of the Fabrique des mobilités Québec, which is itself hosted on secure servers operated by <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/web-security/ssl-certificate">Godaddy</a>, some of which may be located outside of Quebec. . 
</p>
<p>
    The data obtained through the questionnaire will be deleted once the particular analysis is completed. 
</p>
<h4>h. Purpose of the data collected</h4>
<p>
    As part of a project whose objectives are to understand new travel habits and set up shared data governance, the data collected, once anonymized and in compliance with the data charter will be intended to be accessible to public and research actors, via the FabMob website. No data, even anonymized, will be shared for commercial purposes. La FabMob reserves the right to process a set of anonymous data for the purposes of experimentation on the governance and openness of travel data. A data access request form will be available once the data is on the FabMob website.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of anonymization will be to transform personal data through non-reversible algorithms in order to remove any association with an identifiable individual, while allowing them to remain usable for processing for statistical purposes, in other terms, this practice will therefore consist of using techniques to make it impossible to identify people while retaining enough information to be used.
</p>
