This unique randomly generated token is your identifier in the system.

Nobody other than you knows that you are associated with this token. If you
want to communicate with the research team about the data collected about you,
please be prepared to provide this token.

If you already have a token from a previous install, you can use it instead to retain the same account. Note that there are no incorrect tokens. If you enter a token that does not match an existing one, we will create a new account.
