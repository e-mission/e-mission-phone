  <h3>What is the research study about?</h3>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  You are invited to participate in this research study. The aim of this research study is to collect information about the personal travel behaviour of residents of the Sydney metropolitan area. Information about people's day-to-day travel behaviour is critical to predict future travel demand and infrastructure needs.
  </div>

  <h3>Who is conducting this research?</h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
  The study is being carried out by Assoc Prof Taha H. Rashidi and Amarin Siripanich, Research Centre for Integrated Transport Innovation, UNSW Australia.<br>Research Funder: This research is being funded by the Research Centre for Transport Integrated Innovation at UNSW Australia.</br> 
  </div>
  <h3>Inclusion criteria</h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Before you decide to participate, we need to ensure that you meet the inclusion criteria of this research study. You can participate if the following criteria apply to you:
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>You are eighteen years old or older.</li>
    <li>You reside in the metropolitan area of Sydney, Australia.</li>
    <li>You own a smartphone running Android (compatibility varies with device) or Apple iOS 9 (or newer).</li>
    <li>You have a Google/Gmail account.*</li>
  </ul>
  
  <b>*Why do we need your email?</b>
  <br></br>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
    The only login method that the emTripLog application supports is through Google Sign-In. If you do not have a Gmail account or you are not comfortable sharing your real Gmail adress, you can create a fake one to use for this platform. The only reason we use an email address is so that we can identify your data to destroy in case your want to withdraw from the study. Once the study is completed, we will dissociate your data with your email address to ensure your privacy.
  </div>

  <h3>Do I have to take part in this research study?</h3>
  
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
    Participation in any research study is voluntary. If you do not want to take part, you do not have to. If you decide that you want to take part in the research study, you will be asked:
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>To read the information carefully.</li>
    <li>To complete an online questionnaire.</li>
    <li>To participate in a one-week-long data collection with emTriplog, a location-aware travel survey mobile application.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>What does participation in this research require, and are there any risks involved?</h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
    If you decide to take part in the research study, we will ask you to first complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire includes questions about your sociodemographic characteristics, your attitude towards data privacy, and your expection of this travel survey. emTripLog is a location-aware mobile application, which automatically senses and securely stores information about your travel behaviour. emTripLog operates unobtrusively in the background and relies on your smartphone's sensors (GPS and accelorometer) to record your movements. emTripLog also requests additional information about your travel behaviour in the form of short questionnaires that are usually presented at the end of a trip. You will be asked to keep emTripLog active for one week. You will be required to always carry your smartphone on you during the study period and to assure that your smartphone's battery is always sufficiently charged. At the end of the one-week-long study period, you will receive an invitation to a closing questionnaire and will be asked to uninstall emTripLog.
  </div>
  
  The duration of this research study is one week. Participation in this research study is expected to require the following amounts of your personal time:
  <ul>
    <li>10 minutes to complete the opening questionnaire;</li>
    <li>5 minutes to install the emTripLog app;</li>
    <li>Less than 1 minute to fill in questions typically prompted after completion of a trip.</li>
    <li>Less than 10 minutes to complete the closing questionnaire.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Assuming that you complete an average of four trips per day, it is expected that participation in this research study will not consume more than 56 minutes of your time during the entire study period.
  
  All data collected through emTripLog are encrypted and securely transferred to a data server located in on the UNSW campus in Kensington, NSW. emTripLog is designed to minimise data volume usage when transferring data between your device and the server. If both WiFi and cellular network signals are available. emTripLog first uses WiFi to transmit and receive data. If WiFi is unavailable, emTripLog relies on your mobile data plan, whenever a cellular signal is available. You will not be reimbursed for any expenses related to the data usage of emTripLog. Even though emTripLog has been designed to minimise energy consumption, the continued use of location services in the background can dramatically decrease your smartphone's battery life.
  
  We do not exepct that participation in this research study to cause any harm or discomfort. However, should you experience any feelings of distress during your participation in this study, you can let the research team know and they will provide you with assistance.
  </div>

  <h3>What are the possible benefits to participation?</h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  It is hoped that the insights of this research study can inform strategic policy- making processes in the domain of transport and infrastructure planning.
  </div>
  <h3>What will happen to information about me?</h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  By clicking the 'I accept' button on the emTripLog application you are providing your permission for the research team to collect and use information about you for the research study. Your data will be kept indefinitely for future research purposes. We will store information about you electronically in a non-identifiable format at secure server on the grounds of the UNSW campus in Sydney, Australia. Your information will be used to develop behavioural models of travel demand. The results of these models will only be presented in aggregate form and individual data will not be identifiable. The information for this research study may be made available to other research projects in de-identified form only. Researchers at UNSW are required to store their aggregated data in the UNSW data repository, this is a system called ResData. Once the aggregated data is deposited into this repository it will be retained in this system permanently. It will however be retained in a format where your identity will not be known.
  </div>

  <h3>How and when will I find out what the results of the research study are?</h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  The research team intends to publish and report the results of the research study in a variety of ways including presentations at academic conferences and academic journal papers. Information will be published in aggregate form such that individual responses cannot be identified.
  </div>

  <h3>What if I want to withdraw from the research study?</h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  If you do consent to participate, you may withdraw at any time. You can do this by closing the questionnaire or uninstalling the emTripLog mobile application from your phone. If you withdraw from the research we will destroy any information that has already been collected. However, once the data collection is complete, we will not be able to withdraw your responses as the data collection is anonymous.
  </div>

  <h3>How emTripLog works</h3>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  We automatically track your location, accelerometer, device-generated activity
  recognition, and battery usage. We also allow you to optionally enter your
  experiences and feedback during travel through the app. Since our code is
  open source, you can inspect the data that we collect in the background at
