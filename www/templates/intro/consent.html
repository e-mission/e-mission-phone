<div class="consent-text">
<h3>Introduction and Purpose</h3>
I would like to invite you to take part in my research study about travel demands of affordable transit-oriented development. The principal investigator of this project is Professor Karen Chapple. This study evaluates the benefits of living in affordable housing near transit.

<h3>Procedures</h3>
If you agree to participate, we will ask you to answer questions about your travel patterns, modes of travel, common destinations, employment, income, and other factors. You will also be asked to fill out a travel log for a period of 1 day of everywhere you go and how you got there. In total, filling out the survey and travel log should last a maximum of 1.5 hours. In addition to the travel log and survey, we will ask you to download a GPS app onto your smartphone. The GPS app will collect your location for a period of seven continuous days for the purposes of better understanding information collected in the survey and travel log. You are free not to participate in the study.

<h3>Benefits</h3>
There is no direct benefit to you from taking part in this study. It is hoped that the research will help us to better understand the impacts of living in affordable housing near transit on greenhouse gas emissions as well as other benefits. This knowledge will help to better inform future policy and planning efforts locally and at the State regarding the location of affordable housing and access to transportation options.

<h3>Risks/Discomforts</h3>
Some of the questions may make you uncomfortable or upset. If you agree to participate in the study and feel uncomfortable at any time, you can decline to answer a question or stop your participation at any point. Your answers and information will be handled as confidentially as possible; however, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised.

<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
All identifiable information will be either eliminated or, where necessary for future interpretation, will be coded with a key that will be kept in a separate encrypted and locked file on the password-protected computer. Your confidentiality will be maintained in any publication from research results or discussions with persons outside of the research team. Names,addresses, employment information, etc. will not be published or shared with anyone outside of the research team. However, we will save your information in locked files on our computers and will retain the information for 5 years.

<h3>Compensation</h3>
To thank you for participating in this study, you will receive a $50 gift card to Safeway, Target, or Walmart. I will deliver it in person to you after you complete the survey, travel log, and the GPS data collection period has ended. If you choose to end your participation early, we will send you a $20 gift card.

<h3>Rights</h3>
<b><i>Participation in research is completely voluntary</i></b>. You are free to decline to take part in the project. You can decline to answer any questions and are free to stop taking part in the project at any time. Whether or not you choose to participate in the research and whether or not you choose to answer a question or continue participating in the project, there will be no penalty to
you or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
