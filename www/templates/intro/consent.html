</div>
<div class="consent-text">
<h3><center>Introduction</center></h3>

Our names are Vanessa Lin, Samantha Banchik, Bill Cao, Trevor Wu, and Emma Vickery.
We are undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley,working with
faculty advisor Professor David Culler, and graduate student Kalyanaraman Shankari
in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. We are planning
to conduct a research study, which I invite you to take part in.<br />
You are being invited to participate in this study because you have volunteered to do so.<br />

<h3><center>Purpose</center></h3>

The purpose of this study is to find out about choice involving mode of
transportation and what kind of factors which would change one's choice of transportation.
We want to use the context of people’s trips and make a suggestion algorithm that suggests “better” trips,
whether it is better because of utilizing public transit or shorter in distance.
For example, we could compare different notification triggers. The algorithm would send suggestions saying there
is a closer destination of the same category and another mode of transportation takes
less time.

<h3><center>Procedures</center></h3>
If you agree to this study, you will be asked to do the following: <br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li> Allow the E-mission application to run in the background on your phone,
    with the location services turned on, for the duration of the study.</li>
  <li> Take surveys relating to your trips on the E-mission app. </li>
</ul>
The study procedures will be conducted through the E-mission application and
the location and time is contingent on your trips as the data is collected
through the background usage of the phone. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>An email will be sent out indicating the necessary steps to download
    emTripLog and the two-step process that allows participants to download
    our greentrip UI or the control UI. </li>
  <li>You will be notified via email and via a notification on the app when
    the study is over (after two months of the start of the study) and it
    is then that you can delete the application from your phone.</li>
</ul>

<h3><center>During the main part of the study...</center></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>You will be asked to download the E-mission app</li>
  <li>You will allow the app to run in the background on your phone during the time of the study</li>
  <li>You will be asked to have location tracking stay turned on</li>
  <li>You may receive push notifications to fill out survey(s) during the time of
    the study, in which there will be a survey every week for you to complete</li>
</ul>
<b>Study time:</b> Your study participation will take a total of 2 months. <br />
<b>Study location:</b> All study procedures will take place where you travel with your phone. <br />

<h3><center>Benefits</center></h3>
There are no direct benefits for participating in this research. Potential
benefits as a result of our study include having a greater understanding of
sustainable transportation, better and more eco-friendly routes to take and
improving one’s own carbon emissions.<br />

<h3><center>Risks/Discomforts</center></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Your location will be tracked in the background of the app and will be
    able to be accessed by the research team/faculty sponsors.</li>
  <li><b>Breach of confidentiality:</b> As with all research, there is a chance that
    confidentiality could be compromised; however, we are taking precautions to minimize this risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3><center>Confidentiality</center></h3>
Your study data will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of
this study are published or presented, individual names and other personally
identifiable information will not be used.<br />
To minimize the risks to confidentiality, we will maintain limited access to
locations of our subjects to the research team and our advisors.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>We will keep your study data as confidential as possible, with the
    exception of certain information that we must report for legal or ethical
    reasons, such as child abuse, elder abuse, or intent to hurt yourself or others.</li>
  <li><b>Retaining research records:</b> When the research is completed, we may save
    the data of locations for use in future research done by myself or others.
    We will retain this study information as long as the data remains relevant
    and helpful to society.  The same measures described above will be taken to
    protect confidentiality of this study data.</li>
</ul>

<h3><center>Compensation</center></h3>
We plan to offer you a guaranteed monetary incentive administered overtime.
For every month you provide active participation you will be rewarded.
The prize money will be given out via online sources (Venmo, Email, PayPal).
Assuming we get 100 participants, you will be guaranteed $10 at a maximum
if you participate for the entire duration of the study.
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>You will be paid $5 each month out of the two; therefore, if you only
    participate for 1 month, you will be paid only $5. If you participate for two,
    they will be paid $10.</li>
  <li>You will be notified when the study is over given an email from the student
    researchers and a notification from the app</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rights</h3>
<b><i>Participation in research is completely voluntary</i></b>.  You have the
right to decline to participate or to withdraw at any point in this study
without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
