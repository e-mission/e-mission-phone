<h3><center>Introduction and Purpose</center></h3>
Our names are Vanessa Lin, Samantha Banchik, Bill Cao, Emma Vickery, and Trevor Wu.
​We are undergraduate students​ ​at the University of California, Berkeley,​​ working
with faculty advisor Professor David Culler, Professor Randy Katz, and graduate
student Kalyanaraman Shankari in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science. We are planning to conduct a research study, which we invite
you to take part in.
<p>The purpose of this study is to find out about choice involving mode of
  transportation and what factors which would change that.
  We want to use the context of people’s trips and make a suggestion algorithm that suggests “better” trips,
  whether it is better because of utilizing public transit or shorter in distance.
  For example, we could compare different notification triggers and their effects
  on travel behaviors.

<h3>What we collect</h3>
We automatically track your location, accelerometer, device-generated activity
recognition, and battery usage. We also allow you to optionally enter your
experiences and feedback during travel through the app. Since our code is
open source, you can inspect the data that we collect in the background at
<a
href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-data-collection.git</a>,
explore the prompts for optional sentiment reporting at <a
href="https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone.git">https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-phone.git</a>,
and see the analysis that we perform at <a

<h3>How we associate it with you</h3>
You log in to the app using a valid gmail address. We map the gmail address to
a unique UUID and associate all collected data with the UUID. In general, the
mapping between the email address and the UUID will only be made available to
the lead researcher for the platform (Shankari). If you are not comfortable
sharing your real gmail adress, you can create a fake one to use for this
platform. The only reason we use an email address is so that we can ensure that
your data is only available to somebody logged in as you, and remains available
even if you switch phones.

<h3>Who gets to see it</h3>
Individually identified, real-time data is only available to the lead
researcher for the study (Shankari). The data may be shared for aggregate
analysis under two scenarios as described below. It will not be used for
marketing or advertising purposes.
<ul>
<li> Aggregate views of the collected data (both automatic and optional) that
do not show individual trajectories (e.g. heatmaps) will be made publicly
available through the platform website and on the phone app. You can explore
this data on the "aggregate" tab of this app before consenting to data
collection.
<li> Time-delayed subsets of individual trajectory data, associated with their
UUIDs but not email addresses, may by shared with collaborators, or released as
research datasets to the community from time to time. If this is done, the time
delay for sharing with collaborators will be at least one month, and the time
delay for releasing to the community will be at least one year. Both
collaborators and researchers will be asked to agree that they will publish
only aggregate, non personally identifiable results, and will not re-share the
data with others.
</ul>

<h3>Benefits and Compensation</h3>
It is hoped that the
information gained from the study will also help professionals
better understand how applications can help people reduce their carbon emissions
 by use ofsuggestions/suggestion algorithms.

<h3>Your rights</h3>
<b><i>Participation in research is completely voluntary</i></b>.  You have the
right to decline to participate or to withdraw at any point in this study
without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
