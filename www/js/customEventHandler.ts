/**
 * since react doesn't quite support custom events, writing our own handler
 * having the ability to broadcast and emit events prevents files from being tightly coupled
 * if we want something else to happen when an event is emitted, we can just listen for it
 * instead of having to change the code at the point the event is emitted
 *
 * looser coupling = point of broadcast doesn't 'know' what is triggered by that event
 * leads to more extensible code
 * consistent event names help us know what happens when
 *
 * code based on: https://blog.logrocket.com/using-custom-events-react/
