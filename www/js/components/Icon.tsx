/* React Native Paper provides an IconButton component, but it doesn't provide a plain Icon.
  We want a plain Icon that is 'presentational' - not seen as interactive to the user or screen readers, and
  it should not have any extra padding or margins around it. */
/* Using the underlying Icon from React Native Paper doesn't bundle correctly, so the easiest thing to do
  for now is wrap an IconButton and remove its interactivity and padding. */
