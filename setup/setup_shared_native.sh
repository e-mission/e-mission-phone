# By default, node doesn't fail if any of the steps fail. This makes it hard to
# use in a CI environment, and leads to people reporting the node error rather
# than the underlying error. One solution is to pass in a command line argument to node
# to turn off that behavior. However, the cordova script automatically invokes node
# and I don't see a .noderc to pass in the config option for all runs
# So for now, I am going to hack this by adding the command line argument to
# the cordova script. If anybody has a better option, they are welcome to share
# it with us!
